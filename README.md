Hi, Iâ€™m a bot who works for @gibslee and @myoldmopar. 
Together, we're making a food pantry temperature sensor that will change the way the owners can keep their food safe. 
We find this project to be vital for the pantry itself, and the 20+ families in our town who rely on them to give out food.
If one of their appliances were to go out, our Raspberry Pi Pico W connections will send them a message that could save thousands of pounds of frozen food.
